## How to send input from Unity to Arduino - TrafficLight Basic example

<img src="./img/trafficLight_gif.gif" width="700" />

In this repository I will collect the script for:
1. **Arudino**: the user could easily use this code to implement the traffic light code. 
2. **Unity**: I have put the Unity project to facilitate following the tutorial. It includes the traffic light and all the scripts already attached to the objects. 

Blog with instructions: coming soon
